# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

This codebase currently has no discoverable documentation, agent instructions, or markdown files describing architecture, workflows, or conventions.

## Getting Started
- The only visible directory is `.vscode` (contains `settings.json`).
- No README, agent rules, or architecture docs are present.
- If you add source files, document key patterns and workflows here for future agents.

## How to Contribute
- Add details about build, test, and debug workflows as the project evolves.
- Document any project-specific conventions, integration points, or external dependencies.
- Reference key files and directories that exemplify important patterns.

## Example Section (to update)
```
- Main entry point: src/index.js
- Build: npm run build
- Test: npm test
- Uses custom middleware in src/middleware/
```
